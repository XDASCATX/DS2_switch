An experimental Nintendo Switch port of the **Xbox 360** release (Title ID `465307E4`). The game's PowerPC executable is
statically recompiled to ARM64 C++ and rendered by a purpose-built Vulkan renderer on Mesa NVK. **This is neither an
Xbox 360 emulator nor a port of the PC version.**

> [!NOTE]
> You need your **own Xbox 360 game files** and Compatibility Pack 4. No game files, generated game code or keys are
> distributed here.

## Status (build v123)

v123: D24FS8 depth resolves are no longer copied before the float24 pass that rewrites every pixel (about 1.3 ms of GPU time per frame in Majula). v122: the game's Direct3D GPU wait sleeps until the command processor makes progress instead of spinning on a core (`ds2_gpu_wait_sleep`); new textures are no longer rehashed every frame for 2 s after an area loads, and their first hash is deferred by a few frames (ideas from ds2scholar-nx). v121: the shader pack has one fixed name, ds2_shaders.spvlib (+ .idx), so updates replace only ds2.nro and ds2.toml (an older ds2_shaders_vNNN.spvlib is still picked up if present); the start screen cards pulse, the countdown is 20 s and the hints show touch input. v120 removes the ~110 ms stall at every autosave: SD work (file create/delete, closing a written file) no longer runs under the process-wide global lock. v119 restores the shader pack signature: v116 changed spirv_library.cpp, which is hashed into the translator signature, so v116-v117 rejected the pack and translated every shader at runtime (the stutters). v119 = v118 (countdown that survives the launch press, breathing resolution cards) + spirv_library.cpp/.h byte-identical to v115.

- Playable from the new-game intro through Majula, with multiple bosses and the first DLC area tested.
  Russian or English interface (other disc languages through the emulated region).
- Approximately **31–40 FPS** (typically ~33) in demanding scenes with the clocks of the supplied configuration
  (CPU 1963 / GPU 1267 / memory 2500 MHz); about **17–29 FPS** at stock clocks. The limits now are the GPU
  (25–32 ms per frame) and the renderer's command thread (~20 ms).
- Intro videos, saves, DLC, audio, achievements and the controller work.

## How it works

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    XEX["Default.xex<br/>PowerPC"] -->|ReXGlue codegen| CPP["C++<br/>every xex function"]
    CPP --> NRO["NRO · ARM64"]
    RT["ReXGlue runtime<br/>kernel · XAM · VFS · XMA · input"] --> NRO
    HZN["Horizon layer<br/>memory · threads · clocks · present"] --> NRO
    NRO --> PM4["Xenos PM4 ring"]
    PM4 --> NAT["Native renderer<br/>Vulkan"]
    NAT --> NVK["Mesa NVK<br/>+ port patch"] --> GPU["Tegra X1"]
```

The recompiled game still issues its original Xenos (Direct3D 9) commands. A `GPU Commands` thread reads the PM4 ring
and turns its draws, resolves and swaps into Vulkan work, without emulating EDRAM. The ReXGlue runtime provides the
Xbox 360 kernel and XAM; the Switch layer provides memory, threads, audio, input, clocks and presentation.

## Engineering highlights

### Recompiled game code

- **Optimised code generation:** PowerPC registers r14–r31, f14–f31, cr, ctr and xer are C++ locals instead of fields
  of an in-memory context; calls between game functions are direct and can be inlined; guest memory is accessed
  without `volatile`, with compiler barriers on every loop back-edge and on `sync`/`lwsync`/`eieio`. About +25% FPS
  where the CPU is the limit.
- **Correctness of that generation:** function pieces and exception funclets that read their owner's registers are
  marked `share_registers` (only real pieces, checked by prologue analysis); vector registers stay in the context
  because the Bink video decoder passes values between its hand-written VMX functions in them;
  `-fno-strict-aliasing` for the generated code.
- **Discovery:** data-only and code-pointer entry points, recovered gaps and a missing vtable thunk; a scanner fix for
  16-bit jump tables.

### Native renderer

| Mechanism | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Offline shader library** | 1,444 shaders, 35,000+ SPIR-V variants, spirv-opt optimised and indexed; restored on a worker thread, pipelines compiled asynchronously. |
| **Texture signs in the pipeline** | Signed/unsigned/gamma texture components are specialization constants, so the driver removes the per-fetch branches: main passes 20–50% faster on the GPU. |
| **Reduced-resolution particles** | Fog and smoke drawn at half resolution and composited (with a reduced depth buffer for opaque fog); single draws that cost up to 64 ms. |
| **Textures** | 1D, cube and 3D (volume) textures, fast untiling, dynamic textures for videos. |
| **Depth and lighting** | Xenos absolute depth bias through `VK_EXT_depth_bias_control`, float24 depth, correct D24FS8 scale (bonfire light no longer leaks through walls). |
| **Host 4x MSAA** | Hardware MSAA only where the game really renders 4x, instead of sample-space emulation. |
| **CPU side** | Redundant state filtering (~74% of state calls skipped), persistent descriptor sets, constant buffer reuse, per-thread MSR. |

The [Mesa NVK patch](tools/switch/toolchain/mesa-switch-ds2-perf.patch) adds direct UBO handling on Maxwell, a sparse
guest-memory buffer and NAK compiler tuning.

### Platform

- First boot unpacks the DLC and save packages with an on-screen progress bar.
- File system errors on unusual SD cards are logged instead of ending the game.
- Clocks are set from the configuration (needs a clock sysmodule); Russian and other EU languages through the
  emulated game region.
- Built-in diagnostics: GPU profiler per pass and per draw, CPU sampling profiler, crash reports with the guest stack,
  frame captures (L3+R3).

## Installation

  ds2.toml
  ds2_shaders.spvlib        # shader library (name set in ds2.toml)
  ds2_shaders.spvlib.idx
  game_root/Default.xex          # your Xbox 360 game files, original structure

  logs/                          # created by the port

install DARK SOULS II Scholar of the First Sin (port) [0100D52000560000][v0].nsp - using DBI, as usual.
```
 
An NSP forwarder can start `ds2.nro` from the home menu.

> [!NOTE]
> For English-speaking players: The European multilanguage version supports English. To enable it, change user_language = 12 to user_language = 1 in ds2.toml.

**Start screen:** before the game loads, choose the internal resolution (720p native or 540p for more FPS, with optional
sharpening of the upscale), the frame rate lock (30 or 60) and the language (RUS or ENG, Russian by default). The
choice is remembered; on the next start the game launches with it after a 10-second countdown unless a button is
pressed. For another language of the European disc set
`user_language` in `ds2.toml` (3 German, 4 French, 5 Spanish, 6 Italian, 9 Portuguese, 11 Polish): it appears as a third
button, selected by default. `ds2_resolution_prompt = false` skips the screen and uses `ds2_render_scale`,
`ds2_fps_cap` and `user_language` from `ds2.toml`.

**Port menus:** hold **L + R + Plus**, then press a D-pad direction: Up = debug overlay, Right = settings,
Down = log console, Left = achievements.

> [!WARNING]
> The supplied configuration requests non-stock clocks (CPU 1963 MHz, GPU 1267 MHz, RAM 2500 MHz). They only apply
> with a suitable clock sysmodule and hardware. Lower them in `ds2.toml` (`ds2_switch_cpu_mhz`, `ds2_switch_gpu_mhz`,
> `ds2_switch_mem_mhz`; 0 = leave unchanged) to play at stock clocks.
